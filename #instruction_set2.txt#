A failed dereference of a value-type parameter ALWAYS unsets the flag for ANY command.

**A - Tests**
Opcode: DR
Mnemonic: DeReference
Operands: val
Operand types: v
Effect: None
Flag status: Always set

Opcode: EQ
Mnemonic: EQuals
Operands: v1, v2
Operand types: v, v
Effect: None
Flag status: Set if v1 is equal to v2

Opcode: GT
Mnemonic: Greater Than
Operands: v1, v2
Operand types: v, v
Effect: None
Flag status: Set if v1 > v2

Opcode: GE
Mnemonic: Greater or Equal
Operands: v1, v2
Operand types: v, v
Effect: None
Flag status: Set if v1 â‰¥ v2

**B - Modifications**
Opcode: WT
Mnenomic: WriTe
Operands: addr, val
Operand types: r/v, v
Effect: @addr becomes equal to val
Flag status: Always set

Opcode: AD
Mnemonic: ADd
Operands: reg, val
Operand types: r, v
Effect @reg is increased by val, treating both as 32-bit integers.
Flag status: Always set

Opcode: SB
Mnemonic: SuBtract
Operands: r1, v1
Operand types: r, v
Effect: @r1 is decreased by v1, treating both as 32-bit unsigned integers
Flag status: Always set

Opcode: AN
Mnemonic: logical ANd
Operands: r1, v1
Operand types: r, v
Effect: Each bit in r1 becomes set iff it was set before and the corresponding bit in v1 is set.
Flag status: Always set

Opcode: OR
Mnemonic: logical OR
Operands: r1 (r), v1 (v)
Effect: Each bit in r1 becomes set iff it or the corresponding bit in v1 was set.
Flag status: Always set

Opcode: NG
Mnemonic: NeGate
Operands: r1 (r)
Effect: Each set bit in r1 is unset and vice versa.
Flag status: Always set
