2. rwtm
Parameters: rx v
Effect: Writes the contents of rx to memory address v, if possible.
Flag status: Unset if the given memory address wasn't valid, couldn't be written to, or couldn't be dereferenced.

3. rstv
Parameters: rx v
Effect: Sets the contents of rx to the value v.
Flag status: Set if v could be dereferenced (or didn't need to be)

4. rstr
Parameters: rx ry
Effect: Sets the contents of rx to be equal to the contents of ry
Flag status: Always set

5. radv 
Parameters: rx v
Effect: Adds v to the contents of rx, treating them as 32-bit unsigned or two's-complement integers.
Flag status: Unset if v could not be dereferenced, otherwise set.

6. radr
Parameters: rx ry
Effect: Adds the contents of ry to the contents of rx, treating both as 32-bit integers.
Flag status: Always set

7. rlng
Paramters: rx
Effect: Logically negates the contents of rx, leaving each bit set if it was previously unset and vice versa.
Flag status: Always set.

8. rang
Parameters: rx : register
Effect: Negates the contents of rx, treating it as a 32-bit 2's-complement integer.
Flag status: Always set.

9. reqr
Parameters: rx, ry : register, register
Effect: None
Flag status: Set if the contents of rx and ry are equal.

10. reqv
Paramters: rx, v : register, value
Effect: None
Flag status: Set if v could be dereferenced
rgtv #(register greater than value) noop, conditionally sets flag
rgtr #(register greater than register) noop, conditionally sets flag

A2. tdrv
Mnemonic: Test DeReference Value
Parameters: v : value
